* Countries with (C/X)DR studies

** Introduction

   People have been asking me why CDR investigations are only carried
   out in "third world" countries like Chile ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Chile][??!!]]).  So, after asking
   [[https://twitter.com/leoferres/status/1173009065494110208][this twitter question]], I've taken the Netmob 2010, 2011, 2013, 2015
   and 2017 booklets of abstracts that can be found [[http://netmob.org/][here]] and ran the
   following code on them:

** Processing
   #+begin_src shell
   #!/bin/bash
   echoerr() { echo "$@" 1>&2; }
   while read line; do
   echoerr $line
   echo $line
   pdfgrep --color=always --cache -n -i "$line" netmob_abstracts_*.pdf
   done < listofcountries.txt
   #+end_src

   I only worked with the oral presentation booklets (not posters or
   the D4D challenge). This produced

   #+begin_src shell :results raw :exports both
   wc -l bib/countriesfound.txt
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   66135 bib/countriesfound.txt

   using a =listofcountries.txt= file that I found on the
   internet. Many of these lines are false positives though, either
   because of mismatches "Mali" -> "Nor*mali*zed" or other similar
   effects. I then spent some time checking out the files by hand, and
   recording the ones that were effectively a mention of a specific
   country's CDR dataset.

** Results

   The following table is simply an "existence" table, I'm not
   exhaustive, but rather would like to show which countries have been
   studied using these methods *at least once*.

** Notes

1. This is just *one conference* (albeit the most prominent one,
   NetMob) and still, not all papers have been included, meaning I'm
   completely sure that there area many, many other countries/regions
   that have been studies using C/XDR datasets. [ *NB*: As more
   submissions trickle in, I will have to add other sources. ]
2. Sometimes, there may be little information about a dataset in a
   given country, but then it has been studied further in some other
   paper. I have recorded the page and edition of NetMob with the
   most information.
3. There might also be some points where I've missed a piece of
   information, or even a better dataset from the same region. This
   should not impact strongly (or logically negatively) on the fact
   that there *exists* a dataset for that region.
4. This is of course, and by necessity, quick and dirty. Anyone can
   ask me for pull requests, it'd be fantastic to have a rather
   complete list of datasets that have been published. I might come
   back to this running a more exhaustive search in the Netmob pages,
   or I might not, but one thing that could be done is search for all
   instances of the word "data" and see if there are other countries
   that were not picked up by the countries' restrictive regular
   expressions (or more likely cities as well).
